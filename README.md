## Variables: Variation in Sea-Level Rise

We explore the geographical variation in sea-level rise at different locations world-wide. We use data from the NASA sea level projection tool and a google geolocation API to plot a world map.

## Time Series: Average Temperature in Boston

In this example, we study the average temperature in Boston MA, which has been recorded since 1872. We decompose the time series into trend, seasonality and random error term. We also visually investigate the trend component of the time series in more detail and compare the yearly data using de-seasonalization. Additionally we investigate the shift of the summer comparing 1972-1950, 1950-1990 and 1990-2024.

## Spatial Analysis: Biodiversity Protection Status in Massachusetts

The 30x30 goal is a global conservation initiative aimed at protecting 30% of the planetâ€™s land and oceans by 2030. In this context, we analyze the proportion of protected areas in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We find that only GAP 1 and 2 are typically considered protected from logging and mining, a far cry from the nationwide 30x30 pledge.

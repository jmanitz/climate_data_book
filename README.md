## Time Series: Average Temperature in Boston

In this example, we study the average temperature in Boston MA, which has been recorded since 1872. We decompose the time series into trend, seasonality and random error term. We also visually investigate the trend component of the time series in more detail and compare the yearly data using de-seasonalization. Additionally we investigate the shift of the summer comparing 1972-1950, 1950-1990 and 1990-2024.
